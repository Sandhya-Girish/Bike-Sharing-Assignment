# Bike Sharing Assignment
> BoomBikes is a US bike-sharing provider & it aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
3. Essentially, the company wants a model to understand the demand for shared bikes. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
- Hence, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
- There is a need to point out the important parameters using Multiple linear Regression which will help in taking decisions and actions by the BoomBike company.
- The dataset used for analysis is day.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- It is observed that the temperature field is highly correlated to count of the rental bikes. The higher the temperature, more is the demand for the bikes
- Demand for rental bikes is observed as 'high' when seasons are winter & spring, Months are any of Jan, Jul, Sep, Nov & Dec, weather is Mist or Light Snow
- The precision for the model for train set is coming up to 84.3 & test set coming as 81.6 with a difference of 2% and hence, the model looks to be good
